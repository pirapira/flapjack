/-!
Correctness facts for the executable parallel-move lowering.  CakeML's
full-SSA entry setup generates fresh destinations, so its entry move list is
acyclic: no source is one of the destinations.  In that case the lowering can
take every move in source order without using the reserved scratch register.
