/-!
The data model used by the CakeML graph-colouring allocator.

The executable spill allocator in Allocator.lean is deliberately small.  This
module ports the next layer of the source development: Fixed/Atemp/Stemp node
tags, the source-variable to graph-node bijection, and the graph builder that
interprets a clash tree as cliques.

/-! Move worklists and the first coalescing step.

    CakeML keeps move preferences separate from clash edges.  A move is first
    rejected when it is reflexive, already clashes, or has two fixed
    endpoints.  The remaining moves are canonicalised so a fixed endpoint is
    always the coalescing target.  The full CakeML allocator has additional
    freeze and move-revival phases; this section ports the data and the safe
    coalescing transition those phases build on.

/- Function-level graph allocation.  CakeML's full SSA entry sequence makes
   every renamed formal an allocation participant, including an unused formal.
   The seed `Set` below still gives the graph all renamed formals and the
   clash oracle their ABI-entry interference; explicit entry `Move` programs
   are represented separately when the stack boundary is emitted. -/

/-! Full-SSA graph allocation includes the parameter-entry moves in the
    coloured program.  `fixedSources` identifies the source names which are
    already architectural inputs (the usual RISC-V ABI formals); keeping that
    list explicit lets callers choose the same fixed-source policy as the HOL
    allocator. -/
