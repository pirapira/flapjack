/-! Executable regressions for clocked fuel monotonicity: raising the fuel
changes neither the outcome nor the clock.

The three programs are the three shapes the proof distinguishes — a leaf whose
body never mentions the fuel, a `seq` that recurses twice at `fuel`, and a
`while` whose next iteration recurses at `fuel` again. The `while` is the one
worth having: it is where fuel being a *depth* budget rather than a work
budget is easiest to get wrong. -/
