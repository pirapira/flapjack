# Pancake Lean port plan

## Goal

Build a usable Lean 4 development of Pancake, including its executable
compiler pipeline and compiler-correctness theorems. The CakeML checkout in
`cakeml` is the reference implementation and remains useful for cross-checking
definitions, pass ordering, examples, and proof obligations.

## Principles

- Keep the Lean AST close to CakeML's `panLang`/`crepLang`/`loopLang` syntax so
  translation and theorem statements can be compared directly.
- Preserve polymorphism over machine-word values at the syntax boundary; make
  word width and target configuration explicit in later layers.
- Port executable definitions first, then state invariants and correctness
  proofs for each pass. Every ported layer should have small computation tests
  before its proof interface is expanded.
- Keep the CakeML submodule untouched from the parent project. HOL builds can
  be run in the submodule independently with Holmake.

## Stages

1. **Project and syntax foundation**
   - Initialize Lake and pin the Lean toolchain.
   - Port the core declarations from `cakeml/pancake/panLangScript.sml`.
   - Port structural helpers such as shape size and nested sequencing.
   - Add Lean examples/tests for constructors and helper behavior.

2. **Static data and front-end support**
   - Port shape well-formedness, struct contexts, declarations, and the
     Pancake static-checker result/error types.
   - Port parser-facing syntax only after the AST and diagnostics are stable.
   - Establish executable validation examples corresponding to CakeML's
     `static_checker` examples.

3. **Semantics**
   - Define a deterministic big-step/trace semantics for Pancake, including
     memory, calls, exceptions, loops, and foreign calls.
   - State and prove preservation of well-formedness and basic determinism.

4. **Compiler passes**
   - Port `pan_to_crep`, then the simplification/struct/global passes.
   - Port `crep_to_loop`, loop optimisations, liveness, and `loop_to_word`.
   - For each pass, add a simulation relation and a correctness theorem before
     composing it into the full compiler.

5. **Target and end-to-end correctness**
   - Port the word-level/target interface and one concrete backend first.
   - Connect the compiled result to a Lean execution model and prove the
     end-to-end compiler-correctness statement.
   - Add regression programs and differential checks against CakeML/HOL where
     practical.

## Progress

- [x] Initialize Lake with a pinned Lean 4.33.1 toolchain.
- [x] Port the core `panLang` syntax, shape sizing, and nested sequencing.
- [x] Port nested-recursion local/global expression variable-use helpers.
- [x] Port static-checker data types, structural shape validation, and
  declaration-level shape validation.
- [ ] Port full expression/program checking and diagnostics.

## First implementation slice

The initial Lean commit implements stage 1's core in
`Pancake/Language.lean`: shapes, polymorphic expressions, programs, function
and declaration syntax, `nestedSeq`, and shape sizing. The next slice should
port the nested-recursion measure and variable-use helpers, then the
static-checker data types and shape-context operations from
`panStaticScript.sml`, followed by a small executable checker. The static
data/context layer and expression variable-use helpers are now implemented;
full checking remains the next increment.

## Verification workflow

- Lean: `lake build` from the repository root.
- HOL reference: `Holmake` in `cakeml/pancake` (and its relevant child
  directories).
- Keep commits small enough that a syntax/pass port and its proof obligations
  can be reviewed independently.
