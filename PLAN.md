# Flapjack: Pancake Lean port plan

## Goal

Build a usable Lean 4 development of Pancake, including its executable
compiler pipeline and compiler-correctness theorems. The CakeML checkout in
`cakeml` is the reference implementation and remains useful for cross-checking
definitions, pass ordering, examples, and proof obligations.

## Principles

- Keep the Lean AST close to CakeML's `panLang`/`crepLang`/`loopLang` syntax so
  translation and theorem statements can be compared directly.
- Preserve polymorphism over machine-word values at the syntax boundary; make
  word width and target configuration explicit in later layers.
- Port executable definitions first, then state invariants and correctness
  proofs for each pass. Every ported layer should have small computation tests
  before its proof interface is expanded.
- Keep the CakeML submodule untouched from the parent project. HOL builds can
  be run in the submodule independently with Holmake.

## Source-semantics equivalence gate (issue #380)

The source semantics must be CakeML-equivalent before more compiler-
correctness claims are built on top of it. The reference for this audit is
`cakeml/pancake/semantics/panSemScript.sml`, with the word-operation
definitions in `cakeml/compiler/backend/wordLangScript.sml` and the shared
memory boundary in `cakeml/pancake/semantics/loopSemScript.sml` used where
`panSem` delegates to those definitions.

The current Lean implementation is a useful executable fragment, but it is
not yet an equivalent source semantics. In particular:

| Area | CakeML `panSem` | Current Lean status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Values and shaped records | `Val`, `RStruct`, `NStruct`, with declaration and shape checks | `PanValue` and most expression shape checks match the intended structure |
| `Op` | `Add`, `And`, `Or`, and `Xor` fold over arbitrary word lists; `Sub` accepts exactly two words | Model-aware structured and stepped evaluators dispatch through the target model’s complete word operator; legacy no-model paths retain the old binary compatibility behavior ([#382](https://github.com/pirapira/flapjack/issues/382)) |
| Comparisons and shifts | `Lower` is unsigned, `Less` is signed; all `Lsl`, `Lsr`, `Asr`, and `Ror` are defined; `word_sh` returns `NONE` for nonzero amounts at least the word width | Model-aware structured, flat, stepped, and direct RISC-V expressions now use target-model signed/unsigned comparisons and all shifts, including the CakeML shift-range failure; legacy polymorphic paths still need migration ([#383](https://github.com/pirapira/flapjack/issues/383), [#389](https://github.com/pirapira/flapjack/issues/389), [#546](https://github.com/pirapira/flapjack/issues/546)) |
| Word loads/stores | Domain-checked exact aligned word cells | Model-aware `PanMemory` and `PanValues` use explicit domains; legacy evaluator calls retain compatibility fallback |
| Byte and 32-bit accesses | Align to `byte_align`; extract/patch bytes with `be`; `Load32` additionally requires `aligned 2` | Model-aware flat, structured, and stepped evaluators now use the canonical word-cell operations; compatibility fallback remains |
| Structured `Store` | Flatten values into consecutive word cells and fail transactionally on a bad domain | `PanValues` and its stepped evaluator now flatten word leaves into consecutive cells and thread model-backed stores transactionally ([#422](https://github.com/pirapira/flapjack/issues/422)); the standalone `PanMemory` helper remains the flat reference |
| Assignments | `is_valid_value` checks the destination's existing shape | Generic structured, flat, stepped, and stateful-FFI assignment paths now reject absent or wrongly shaped destinations; call-result destination checks remain ([#384](https://github.com/pirapira/flapjack/issues/384)) |
| Shared memory | `sh_memaddrs`, `nb_op`, and `call_FFI (SharedMem MappedRead/MappedWrite)`; size zero is a distinct word operation; `ShMemLoad` requires an existing word destination | The model-aware structured, stepped, and stateful-FFI evaluators now enforce the word destination rule, while carrying size-aware shared calls, aligned domains, and terminal outcomes; stateful final shared stores preserve locals as in `sh_mem_store`; legacy evaluators retain compatibility paths |
| Control state | Clock, timeout, local clearing at boundaries, return/exception size limits, and declared exception shapes | The clocked stateful-FFI evaluator now charges calls, while iterations, and `Tick`, returns explicit timeouts with empty locals, and rejects invalid callee terminal outcomes; the established structured, flat, stepped, and stateful-FFI paths enforce 32-word bounds and local clearing ([#387](https://github.com/pirapira/flapjack/issues/387)) |
| Calls and FFI | Callee globals/memory and FFI state are threaded; call results/handlers are shape-checked; external calls read/write byte arrays; invalid callee control results become errors | Structured, stepped, flat, and stateful-FFI evaluators now propagate callee globals/memory (and stateful FFI state where applicable), reject normal/break/continue callee completion, and enforce declaration-driven parameter, return, exception, and handler shapes. Generic call destinations validate local/global shapes and stand-alone calls discard returned values; remaining control-state checks and legacy compatibility-path migration remain ([#386](https://github.com/pirapira/flapjack/issues/386), [#388](https://github.com/pirapira/flapjack/issues/388), [#406](https://github.com/pirapira/flapjack/issues/406)) |
| Declaration ordering | `decs_stcnames` validates and collects all struct declarations before `evaluate_decls` | `collectPanValueStructs` now pre-collects the complete struct context while retaining preceding-context validation for struct fields, so later struct declarations may be referenced by earlier globals, functions, and exceptions ([#548](https://github.com/pirapira/flapjack/issues/548)) |

The flat-memory adapter and the structured/stepped canonical access slice now
use the CakeML representation for ordinary structured word loads/stores when a
target model is supplied. They do not by themselves make the complete source
semantics equivalent. The following work is now the source-semantics gate and should
precede new end-to-end correctness claims that depend on arbitrary memory or
shared-memory behavior.

### Stacked implementation plan

1. **Word/memory model and executable reference tests.** Introduce a small
   common interface for word alignment, byte extraction/patching, 32-bit
   packing, endianness, and memory-domain checks. Keep the generic source
   semantics polymorphic, and instantiate the RISC-V target with little
   endian behavior. Add tests that distinguish aligned-cell access from exact
   address access and cover missing cells, unaligned `Load32`, both byte
   positions, and endian order.
2. **Canonical source memory operations.** Implement CakeML's
   `mem_load_byte`, `mem_store_byte`, `mem_load_32`, and `mem_store_32` in the
   source memory layer. Make ordinary `Store` flatten to consecutive word
   cells, and make all reads/writes use the explicit main-memory domain.
   The structured `PanValues` and stepped paths now use shape-directed loads,
   consecutive word stores, and typed model access; retain the standalone
   `PanMemory` helpers as the flat reference and integrate the remaining
   sub-word behavior into one canonical interface.
3. **Expression and statement agreement.** Model-aware structured and stepped
   evaluation now dispatches variadic word operations and signed/unsigned
   comparisons and all shift operators through the target model. Complete
   this stage for legacy and flat paths. Assignment destination shape checks
   are now shared by the generic structured, flat, stepped, and stateful-FFI
   evaluators. Assignment and ordinary call-result destination checks now
   cover generic structured, flat, stepped, stateful-FFI, and RISC-V paths;
   stand-alone and declaration calls handle return values according to
   CakeML. Generic structured and stepped evaluators now enforce declaration-
   driven parameter, return, exception, and handler shape checks; integrate the same
   contract environment into the flat paths. The four model-aware call
   evaluators now enforce declaration-driven return, exception, and handler
   contracts; the cost-instrumented call evaluator applies the same
   declaration parameter checks and rejects invalid callee terminal results.
   Add the
   missing `store32`/
   `storeByte` cases to the flat control evaluator and prove that the
   counted/stepped expression evaluator has the same value result as the
   uncounted evaluator.
4. **Shared-memory and external effects.** Model-aware structured and stepped
   evaluators now have a separate shared-memory callback/domain and a
   stateful stepped path with FFI state, terminal observations, size-dispatched
   `op8`/`op16`/`op32`/`opW` behavior, model-backed byte-array `ExtCall`
   reads/writes, and a public declaration/entry-point wrapper. Shared loads now
   reject absent, structured, or non-word destinations as required by `panSem`.
   Complete this
   stage by proving the remaining byte-domain and length-failure
   correspondence, then migrate callers from the legacy pure evaluator.
   Preserve the existing pure handler adapters as explicitly non-observable
   compatibility fixtures.
5. **Control-state fidelity.** Return and exception payloads are now bounded
   to CakeML's 32-word limit, and direct returns and uncaught exceptions clear
   locals, in structured, flat, stepped, and stateful-FFI evaluators. Next
   thread CakeML's clock and timeout rules through `Tick`, `While`, calls,
   returns, and exceptions. The stateful-FFI evaluator now has a separate
   clocked API covering these transitions; extend its proofs and migrate the
   generic compatibility paths next. The generic structured and stepped call evaluators
   now return callee globals and memory to callers, matching the existing flat
   and stateful-FFI paths. Generic structured and stepped paths now carry
   declaration environments for return, exception, and handler contracts in
   all four model-aware call evaluators; complete the remaining control
   checks and migrate legacy compatibility paths.
6. **Correctness and migration.** Rebase source-to-Crepe, stepped-semantics,
   flat-memory, and source-to-RISC-V theorems on the canonical evaluator.
   Keep focused counterexamples for every formerly permissive behavior and
   add differential executable fixtures against the corresponding HOL
   definitions. Only then remove the equivalence gate and resume broad
   compiler-pipeline correctness work.

Until steps 1--3 land, existing source-memory milestones should be read as
preliminary executable fragments, not proofs of equivalence with `panSem`.

Issue #513 is covered across the structured, stepped, flat, stateful-FFI, and
clocked evaluators: a `DecCall` whose callee raises now propagates the raised
outcome, while direct uncaught calls retain their failure behavior.

The stateful ExtCall byte-array helper now follows CakeML's `write_bytearray`
ordering and failure fallback, including its behavior when a later byte store
cannot be performed; the RISC-V regression keeps the successful prefix visible.

## Stages

1. **Project and syntax foundation**
   - Initialize Lake and pin the Lean toolchain.
   - Port the core declarations from `cakeml/pancake/panLangScript.sml`.
   - Port structural helpers such as shape size and nested sequencing.
   - Add Lean examples/tests for constructors and helper behavior.

2. **Static data and front-end support**
   - Port shape well-formedness, struct contexts, declarations, and the
     Pancake static-checker result/error types.
   - Establish executable validation examples corresponding to CakeML's
     `static_checker` examples.
   - **Done:** port Pancake's own front end — `panLexer`, the `panPEG`
     grammar, and the `panPtreeConversion` conversion — to Lean, producing
     Flapjack AST values. See [`Flapjack/Parser/README.md`](Flapjack/Parser/README.md)
     for the module map, the three places this port departs from upstream
     (`@top`, and `Load32`/`Store32` in the localisation pass), the upstream
     quirks it keeps, and the `locations` option that reproduces
     `add_locs_annot`. The grammar and the conversion are two stages with a
     `panPEG` parse tree between them, as upstream, converted by a port of
     `panPtreeConversion`. Tests are in `Flapjack/Test/Parser.lean` and
     `Flapjack/Test/ParserStaticExamples.lean`, covering every example in
     `cakeml/pancake/parser/panConcreteExamplesScript.sml` and the 276
     referenced examples in
     `cakeml/pancake/static_checker/panStaticExamplesScript.sml`. Parser
     output is also fed through `staticCheck` and `compileToCrepe`; the seven
     places Flapjack's static checker disagrees with upstream on those
     examples are tabulated in the parser README as `Flapjack/Static.lean`
     gaps.
   - **Done:** make parse-tree span tracking constant-time by carrying the
     last consumed token location through the parser state, while restoring it
     across ordered-choice and optional backtracking. This removes the
     quadratic prefix reconstruction from `P.spanned` without changing the
     location-sensitive parser output.

3. **Semantics**
   - Define a deterministic big-step/trace semantics for Pancake, including
     memory, calls, exceptions, loops, and foreign calls.
   - State and prove preservation of well-formedness and basic determinism.

4. **Compiler passes**
   - Port `pan_to_crep`, then the simplification/struct/global passes.
   - Port `crep_to_loop`, loop optimisations, liveness, and `loop_to_word`.
   - For each pass, add a simulation relation and a correctness theorem before
     composing it into the full compiler.

5. **Target and end-to-end correctness**
   - Port the word-level/target interface and one concrete backend first.
   - **In progress:** execute CakeML's normalized two-word `LongDiv` in the
     abstract StackLang machine. Its RISC-V target boundary remains separate:
     CakeML's RISC-V encoder lowers `LongDiv` through runtime support rather
     than a native instruction.
   - **In progress:** make WordLang `LocValue` label-aware in allocator
   analyses. The destination is an SSA variable; the label is code metadata,
   not a source register. The executable Loop/Word/Stack semantics and their
   end-to-end label environment remain to be migrated.
   The Word-to-Stack lowering now emits StackLang `LocValue` directly for
   register destinations and materializes it through the scratch register
   for spilled destinations; the abstract StackLang evaluator still needs a
   code-label environment before this path can be executed there. Loop-to-Word
   now preserves labels as metadata as well; the legacy direct agreement
   lemmas make their no-label-renaming assumption explicit until the direct
   evaluator is replaced by the layout-aware Lab path. The code-aware
   StackAlloc evaluator now validates StackLang LocValue labels and writes an
   abstract label pointer; frame-machine and layout-aware equivalence remain.
   The bounded FrameMachine now has the same validated abstract transition;
   layout-aware target-position materialization is still a separate Lab
   boundary.
   - Use `/home/zksecurity/HOL/examples/l3-machine-code/riscv/model/riscv.sml`
     as the RISC-V architectural reference; copy `/home/zksecurity/HOL/COPYRIGHT`
     into the Lean RISC-V model subdirectory when that port starts.
   - Connect the compiled result to a Lean execution model and prove the
     end-to-end compiler-correctness statement.
   - Add regression programs and differential checks against CakeML/HOL where
     practical.

## First implementation slice

The initial Lean commit implements stage 1's core in
`Flapjack/Language.lean`: shapes, polymorphic expressions, programs, function
and declaration syntax, `nestedSeq`, and shape sizing. The next slice should
port the nested-recursion measure and variable-use helpers, then the
static-checker data types and shape-context operations from
`panStaticScript.sml`, followed by a small executable checker. The static
data/context layer, expression variable-use helpers, Crepe IR, expression
lowering, and core structured statement lowering are now implemented; full
checking and semantic simulation remain the next increments. The correctness
stack now also has the HOL-aligned `localisedExp`/`localisedProg` boundary in
`CrepeExpressionRelation.lean`; the next proof slice should use this domain to
complete the nested-inductive expression simulation lemma.

## Verification workflow

- Lean: `lake build` from the repository root.
- HOL reference: `Holmake` in `cakeml/pancake` (and its relevant child
  directories).
- Keep commits small enough that a syntax/pass port and its proof obligations
  can be reviewed independently.
