# Flapjack

Flapjack is beginning as a Lean 4 port of the formally verified Pancake
compiler. It is an early-stage project: the current Lean code covers the
front-end syntax and declaration-level checking foundations, the first Pancake-to-Crepe and
Crepe-to-Loop compiler slices, executable semantic fragments, and an initial
RISC-V model. The CakeML HOL development is included as the `cakeml`
submodule; its Pancake sources are in [`cakeml/pancake`](cakeml/pancake).

The Lean library currently contains the core Pancake syntax in
[`Flapjack/Language.lean`](Flapjack/Language.lean) and the static-checker
data/context layer plus shape-aware core expression and structured-program
checkers in [`Flapjack/Static.lean`](Flapjack/Static.lean), as well as
the Crepe IR and expression lowerer in [`Flapjack/Crepe.lean`](Flapjack/Crepe.lean)
and [`Flapjack/PanToCrep.lean`](Flapjack/PanToCrep.lean).
The first HOL `pan_simp` normalization pass is in
[`Flapjack/PanSimp.lean`](Flapjack/PanSimp.lean); the HOL notice for the
front-end port is in [`Flapjack/COPYRIGHT`](Flapjack/COPYRIGHT).
Named-structure elimination is in
[`Flapjack/PanStructs.lean`](Flapjack/PanStructs.lean).
The global heap-rewriting core is in
[`Flapjack/PanGlobals.lean`](Flapjack/PanGlobals.lean).
The composed pass pipeline is in
[`Flapjack/Pipeline.lean`](Flapjack/Pipeline.lean).
Core structured statement lowering and top-level function assembly are in
[`Flapjack/Compile.lean`](Flapjack/Compile.lean).
The first executable local/memory semantics and preservation lemmas are in
[`Flapjack/Semantics.lean`](Flapjack/Semantics.lean).
The Loop intermediate language and Crepe-to-Loop compiler are in
[`Flapjack/Loop.lean`](Flapjack/Loop.lean) and
[`Flapjack/CrepToLoop.lean`](Flapjack/CrepToLoop.lean). The compiler now
threads fresh temporaries through expression lowering and handles the main
memory, control-flow, call, exception, return, shared-memory, and FFI
equations; the earlier structural helper remains available for comparison.
The first Loop data-flow analyses are in
[`Flapjack/LoopAnalysis.lean`](Flapjack/LoopAnalysis.lean).
The first fuel-bounded Loop evaluator and its control-result semantics,
including a call-aware recursive function-table bridge, are in
[`Flapjack/LoopSemantics.lean`](Flapjack/LoopSemantics.lean).
That module also exposes an explicit host-handler boundary for FFI effects.
Its executable arithmetic fragment includes word division and the RISC-V
LongMul lowering; long division and the remaining target-specific arithmetic
cases are still staged separately.
The initial Word IR and Loop-to-Word lowering are in
[`Flapjack/Word.lean`](Flapjack/Word.lean); its backend subdirectory carries
the HOL notice at [`Flapjack/Word/COPYRIGHT`](Flapjack/Word/COPYRIGHT).
The initial RISC-V target vocabulary, register/memory primitives, and
`ADD`/`ADDI` transition slice are in [`Flapjack/RiscV/Model.lean`](Flapjack/RiscV/Model.lean).
The model also includes HOL-aligned unsigned `DIVU`/`REMU` transitions,
including the architectural divide-by-zero results; Word division selects
`DIVU` in the current target slice.
The model and selector also cover the immediate bitwise forms `ANDI`, `ORI`,
and `XORI`, as well as subtraction by an immediate via `ADDI`; immediate
`SLLI`, `SRLI`, and `SRAI` shifts are also modeled and selected.
HOL’s multi-instruction rotate-right lowering is also selected for immediate
and register shift counts, using `x31` as a reserved scratch register and
rejecting source/destination aliases with that register.
Nonzero immediate conditional operands use the corresponding HOL `ORI` or
`ANDI` scratch materialization; conditions that would clobber `x31` are
rejected in this partial target boundary.
The Word arithmetic selector also includes the HOL two-instruction `LongMul`
lowering (`MULHU` followed by `MUL`) and the six-instruction `AddCarry`
lowering. `WordProg.shareInst` with a register-valued address, or a supported
register-plus-constant address expression, now lowers the six HOL memory
operators to the corresponding RISC-V load/store instruction; the same cases
are available in the executable evaluator and call-aware function selector.
The first Word-to-RISC-V selector, PC-aware code runner, and soundness lemmas
for the supported straight-line and register/zero-conditional fragments are
in [`Flapjack/RiscV/Backend.lean`](Flapjack/RiscV/Backend.lean). Equality,
signed ordering, and unsigned ordering branches are modeled; the remaining
bit-test conditions use the condition register as a dead temporary, and the
Loop-to-Word ticks use an `ADDI x0,x0,0` no-op, and the remaining Word
instructions are still explicitly partial. Function-level conditionals with
matching branch return layouts now cross this artifact boundary. The HOL notice is in
[`Flapjack/RiscV/COPYRIGHT`](Flapjack/RiscV/COPYRIGHT).
The selector’s function artifact records both emitted instructions and return
registers for the supported straight-line fragment. `executeFunction` in the
backend initializes parameter registers and collects return registers; the
pipeline exposes an end-to-end Pancake-to-artifact wrapper for that fragment.
Normalized ordinary `WordProg.store` operations use the same register or
register-plus-constant address materialization as `shareInst`; global
`TopAddr`/pseudo-store resolution remains a later target-configuration step.
The first library-level source-to-RISC-V correctness theorem for this composed
pipeline is in [`Flapjack/Correctness.lean`](Flapjack/Correctness.lean).
Word-level function-table call semantics are in
[`Flapjack/WordSemantics.lean`](Flapjack/WordSemantics.lean).
The initial explicit RISC-V call convention is in
[`Flapjack/RiscV/Calls.lean`](Flapjack/RiscV/Calls.lean); function-label
linking and label resolution are in
[`Flapjack/RiscV/Link.lean`](Flapjack/RiscV/Link.lean).
The linker now performs a provisional signature/layout pass followed by a
label-resolving code-generation pass for handler-free Word calls, and the
tests execute a linked multi-function image through `JALR`.
The composed pipeline now exposes its linked function table on
`FlapjackRiscVResult.linkedFunctions` and its call-aware table on
`FlapjackRiscVResult.callLinkedFunctions`.

Build it with:

```sh
lake build
```

The staged port is documented in [`PLAN.md`](PLAN.md).
