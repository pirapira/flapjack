`native_decide` compiles the goal and trusts the result, attaching a
per-theorem axiom. Try in order:

  decide            -- when the elaborator can reduce the Decidable instance
  decide +kernel    -- when it cannot, because reduction stalls on a
                       `termination_by` definition; the kernel unfolds many,
                       but not all: it does not get past `compileExp`, so a
                       goal that runs the compiler over a program containing
                       an expression is out of reach this way
  #guard <prop>     -- for an `example` or an uncited regression check: keeps
                       the check, produces no proof term, needs no axiom

If no tactic reaches the goal, ask next whether the result needs to be a
theorem. An uncited execution check does not, and `#guard` discharges it with
no axiom. Check per site rather than per file -- sites in one file differ.

If the use is genuinely necessary, add these lines to
scripts/native-decide-allowlist.txt, under a note saying why:

  printf '  %s\n' "${needed[@]}" >&2
