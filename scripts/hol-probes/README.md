# Original Pancake HOL probes

The repository-wide parity workflow is documented in
[`docs/PARITY-TESTING.md`](../../docs/PARITY-TESTING.md).

The files in this directory execute definitions from the CakeML Pancake HOL
development. They are test-data generators, not independent Lean reference
implementations. A parity fixture may be used to close a porting bead only
when it records the original source definition, the probe source, and the
command used to regenerate its output.

The probes currently cover the small `loop_to_word` slice used by
`Flapjack.Test.LoopToWord`, the `panSem$mem_load` boundary used by
`Flapjack.Test.PanMemoryParity`, the fixed-width load boundary used by
`Flapjack.Test.PanFixedLoadParity`, and the `panSem$shape_of` boundary used by
`Flapjack.Test.PanShapeParity`, plus the `panSem` word/value helpers used by
`Flapjack.Test.PanWordParity`. The fixed-width store boundary is covered by
`Flapjack.Test.PanFixedStoreParity`, and the word-store boundary by
`Flapjack.Test.PanFlatStoreParity`. Value flattening is covered by
`Flapjack.Test.PanFlattenParity`; scoped local restoration (`res_var_def`) is
covered by `Flapjack.Test.PanResVarParity`. Their source references are
respectively
`cakeml/pancake/loop_to_wordScript.sml` and
`cakeml/pancake/semantics/panSemScript.sml`; `Flapjack.Test.PanOpParity`
additionally probes `pan_op_def` at lines 191--193.
`Flapjack.Test.LoopSetVarParity` probes `set_var_def` at
`cakeml/pancake/semantics/loopSemScript.sml:108-110`.
`Flapjack.Test.LoopDecClockParity` probes `dec_clock_def` at lines 42--43 of
the same source.
`Flapjack.Test.LoopFixClockParity` probes `fix_clock_def` at lines 46--49.
`Flapjack.Test.PanEvaluateDeclsParity` probes `evaluate_decls_def` at
`cakeml/pancake/semantics/panSemScript.sml:814-835`, including each declaration
constructor, ordered global updates, local clearing during initializer
evaluation, an in-domain word load, function-code replacement, and
shape/duplicate failure cases.
`pan_sem_state_eval_probe.out` records direct HOL EVAL of `eval_def` at
`cakeml/pancake/semantics/panSemScript.sml:209-297` for in-domain and
out-of-domain word loads, little- and big-endian byte loads, 32-bit loads, and
list-valued word operators with accepted and rejected operand counts. The
state-derived Lean boundary and its matching cases live in
`Flapjack.Pancake.Semantics.PanSemStateEval` and
`Flapjack.Test.PanSemStateEvalParity`.
`compile_def_probe.out` also records direct HOL evaluations of assigned Global
call destinations through `pan_to_crep$compile`: absent lookups, the
`One`/empty-list fallback, and inconsistent shape/name-list lengths. The
matching Lean cases live in `Flapjack.Test.CompileDefParity`.
`excp_rel_probe.out` and `ctxt_fc_probe.out` are direct EVALs from
`pan_to_crepProofTheory`, paired with `Flapjack.Test.PanToCrepRelationsParity`.
The `excp_rel` cases deliberately use a word-valued compiler-code map and a
shape-valued source map, matching the definition's independent HOL value types.
The `ctxt_fc` cases record `with_shape` slot slicing, ZIP truncation, and
`MAX_LIST` on an empty name list.
`code_rel_probe.out` records the HOL-inferred source/target code-map types,
compiled parameter return, localisation outcomes, function-signature lookup,
and target entry. The probe also proves matching and deliberately mismatching
`code_rel` instances against `code_rel_def`; the corresponding Lean relation
analogue tests live in `Flapjack.Test.PanToCrepCodeRelParity`. The Lean
relation remains untagged until its list-backed compiler body is replaced by
the exact HOL `compile` port tracked by bead `flapjack-pxn.18.3.1.4`.
`globals_lookup_probe.out` records direct HOL EVAL of
`pan_to_crepProof$globals_lookup_def` for a present singleton word and a
missing global; the matching Lean guards live in
`Flapjack.Test.PanToCrepGlobalsLookupParity`.
`crep_arith_dest_const_probe.out` records direct HOL EVAL of
`crep_arith$dest_const_def` at
`cakeml/pancake/crep_arithScript.sml:10-12` for a constant, variable, load,
and multiplication expression. Its Lean constructor checks live in
`Flapjack.Test.CrepeDestConstParity`.
`crep_dest_2exp_probe.out` records direct HOL EVAL of
`crep_arith$dest_2exp_def` at `cakeml/pancake/crep_arithScript.sml:15`, including
the corresponding `word_lsl 1w` results for successful exponents. Its Lean
destination, shift, and width checks live in `Flapjack.Test.CrepeDest2ExpParity`.
`crep_arith_eval_mul_const_probe.out` records direct HOL EVAL of
`crepSem$eval` after `crep_arith$mul_const` for zero, one, power-of-two, and
general multipliers, with a word-valued local. Its matching production runtime
cases live in `Flapjack.Test.CrepeMulConstParity`.
`pan_globals_compile_top_probe.out` records original Pancake HOL evaluation
of `pan_globals$compile_top` for an absent start function (the total empty-list
result), a present `main` entry, and a global initializer in a nonempty
declaration list. Its Lean checks live in
`Flapjack.Test.PanGlobalsCompileTopForStartParity`.
`pan_structs_afindi_map_probe.out` records direct HOL EVAL for the hit and
miss cases of `afindi_MAP_eq` at
`cakeml/pancake/proofs/pan_structsProofScript.sml:356`; its matching Lean
checks live in `Flapjack.Test.PanStructsAfindiParity`.
`pan_structs_afindi_length_probe.out` records direct HOL EVAL of first and
last successful key indices against `afindi_less_length` at
`cakeml/pancake/proofs/pan_structsProofScript.sml:345`; Lean checks the same
rows in `Flapjack.Test.PanStructsAfindiParity`.
`pan_structs_afindi_el_probe.out` records direct HOL EVAL of the first
component at first, middle and last successful `afindi` indices for
`afindi_EL` at `cakeml/pancake/proofs/pan_structsProofScript.sml:430`; Lean
checks the equivalent `getElem?`-based API in
`Flapjack.Test.PanStructsAfindiParity`.
The `longdiv_code_probe.out` fixture probes the original software LongDiv
helper at `cakeml/compiler/backend/data_to_wordScript.sml:829-867` and the
RISC-V target's deliberate LongDiv encoding rejection.
The `prog_if_probe.out` fixture probes the comparison-materialization helper
`prog_if_def` at `cakeml/pancake/crep_to_loopScript.sml:34`, including its
canonical live-set insertion order.
The `compile_crepop_probe.out` fixture probes the RISC-V `Mul` case of
`compile_crepop_def` at line 42 of the same source.
The original Pancake source-level support boundary is also explicit in
`cakeml/pancake/proofs/loop_to_wordProofScript.sml:2285-2291`: `LLongDiv` is
accepted by `loop_inst_ok` only for `x86_64`. Consequently, RISC-V parity must
port the `data_to_word` helper path rather than add a direct RISC-V lowering
for source `LLongDiv`.

From the repository root, with HOL4 and the CakeML checkout available,
regenerate both checked-in outputs with:

```sh
scripts/hol-probes/regenerate.sh
```

Normal Lean CI consumes the checked-in output and does not require HOL4. A
reviewer with HOL4 can rerun the command and inspect the diff. Each probe's
declaration and source path make its reference boundary explicit. The script
is incremental: a fixture is rerun only when its probe, the Pancake theory it
observes, or the script itself is newer than that fixture. Delete a fixture
when a forced regeneration is desired. To refresh one fixture while developing,
set `HOL_PROBE_ONLY` to its probe filename, for example:

```sh
HOL_PROBE_ONLY=pan_globals_compile_top_probeScript.sml scripts/hol-probes/regenerate.sh
```

The checked-in source-facing compiler corpus at
`scripts/parity-small-corpus.json` complements these semantic probes. Run
`scripts/parity-small-corpus.py` after building `flapjack-compile` to invoke
the original `cake --pancake --target=riscv` compiler and Flapjack on the same
five supported programs. The manifest records each original Cake stdout hash,
the CakeML semantic definition exercised by the fixture, and the P1 beads that
own any current generated/user-code differences. The runner compares the
complete runtime, generated-entry, and user-function sections; it does not
normalize instruction bytes.

The focused Pan-to-Crep fixtures are summarized in
[`docs/PAN-TO-CREP-PARITY-COVERAGE.md`](../../docs/PAN-TO-CREP-PARITY-COVERAGE.md).
CI validates that each listed direct-HOL case remains present in its committed
probe output and in the corresponding Lean test with
`scripts/pan-to-crep-coverage-report.py --check`.
