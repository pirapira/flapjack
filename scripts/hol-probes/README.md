# Original Pancake HOL probes

The repository-wide parity workflow is documented in
[`docs/PARITY-TESTING.md`](../../docs/PARITY-TESTING.md).

The files in this directory execute definitions from the CakeML Pancake HOL
development. They are test-data generators, not independent Lean reference
implementations. A parity fixture may be used to close a porting bead only
when it records the original source definition, the probe source, and the
command used to regenerate its output.

`semantics_props_implements_probe.out` prints the proved HOL
`semanticsPropsTheory.implements'_trans` conclusion from
`cakeml/semantics/proofs/semanticsPropsScript.sml:285-295`. The structural
Lean analogue and behavior-extension regressions are in
`Flapjack.Test.SemanticsPropsParity`; the HOL `llist` to Lean
`CakeLazyList` carrier bridge remains unproved, so this evidence does not
qualify those declarations for exact HOL tags.

The probes currently cover the small `loop_to_word` slice used by
`Flapjack.Test.LoopToWord`, the `panSem$mem_load` boundary used by
`Flapjack.Test.PanMemoryParity`, the fixed-width load boundary used by
`Flapjack.Test.PanFixedLoadParity`, and the `panSem$shape_of` boundary used by
`Flapjack.Test.PanShapeParity`, plus the `panSem` word/value helpers used by
`Flapjack.Test.PanWordParity`. The fixed-width store boundary is covered by
`Flapjack.Test.PanFixedStoreParity`, and the word-store boundary by
`Flapjack.Test.PanFlatStoreParity`. Value flattening is covered by
`Flapjack.Test.PanFlattenParity`; scoped local restoration (`res_var_def`) is
covered by `Flapjack.Test.PanResVarParity`. Their source references are
respectively
`cakeml/pancake/loop_to_wordScript.sml` and
`cakeml/pancake/semantics/panSemScript.sml`; `Flapjack.Test.PanOpParity`
additionally probes `pan_op_def` at lines 191--193.
`Flapjack.Test.LoopSetVarParity` probes `set_var_def` at
`cakeml/pancake/semantics/loopSemScript.sml:108-110`.
`Flapjack.Test.LoopDecClockParity` probes `dec_clock_def` at lines 42--43 of
the same source.
`Flapjack.Test.LoopFixClockParity` probes `fix_clock_def` at lines 46--49.
`Flapjack.Test.PanEvaluateDeclsParity` probes `evaluate_decls_def` at
`cakeml/pancake/semantics/panSemScript.sml:814-835`, including each declaration
constructor, ordered global updates, local clearing during initializer
evaluation, an in-domain word load, function-code replacement, and
shape/duplicate failure cases.
`pan_sem_state_eval_probe.out` records direct HOL EVAL of `eval_def` at
`cakeml/pancake/semantics/panSemScript.sml:209-297` for in-domain and
out-of-domain word loads, little- and big-endian byte loads, 32-bit loads, and
list-valued `word_op_def` operators with accepted and rejected operand counts.
The source-shaped generic definition is `Flapjack.Pancake.wordOpHOL`; its
all-width equation to the production RISC-V target is in
`Flapjack.Pancake.Semantics.CrepRuntimeTarget`. The state-derived Lean
boundary and its matching cases live in
`Flapjack.Pancake.Semantics.PanSemStateEval` and
`Flapjack.Test.PanSemStateEvalParity`.
`pan_sem_e2e_probe.out` records direct HOL evaluation cases for nonempty
state-owned code maps, including recursive Call, DecCall, nested Call/DecCall,
and clock timeout. `pan_sem_call_return_shape_probe.out` adds Call and DecCall
cases where the callee's actual returned value disagrees with the return shape
stored in the code map; HOL returns `SOME Error`, preserves the decremented
clock, and exposes the callee post-state. Their Lean checks live in
`Flapjack.Test.PanEvaluateParity` and exercise the recursive
`PanSemState.code` evaluator.
`compile_def_probe.out` also records direct HOL evaluations of assigned Global
call destinations through `pan_to_crep$compile`: absent lookups, the
`One`/empty-list fallback, and inconsistent shape/name-list lengths. The
matching Lean cases live in `Flapjack.Test.CompileDefParity`.
`excp_rel_probe.out` and `ctxt_fc_probe.out` are direct EVALs from
`pan_to_crepProofTheory`, paired with `Flapjack.Test.PanToCrepRelationsParity`.
The `functions_projection` row in `ctxt_fc_probe.out` directly checks the
HOL `ctxt_fc_funcs_eq` theorem at `pan_to_crepProofScript.sml:2295` against
the kernel-checked Lean fixture in that module. The `vmax_nonempty_list` and
`vmax_empty_list` rows directly check `ctxt_fc_vmax` at line 2307 and are
paired with `ctxtFcVmax` Lean fixtures.
The `excp_rel` cases deliberately use a word-valued compiler-code map and a
shape-valued source map, matching the definition's independent HOL value types.
The `ctxt_fc` cases record `with_shape` slot slicing, ZIP truncation, and
`MAX_LIST` on an empty name list.
`code_rel_probe.out` records the HOL-inferred source/target code-map types,
compiled parameter return, localisation outcomes, function-signature lookup,
and target entry. The probe also proves matching and deliberately mismatching
`code_rel` instances against `code_rel_def`; the corresponding Lean relation
analogue tests live in `Flapjack.Test.PanToCrepCodeRelParity`. The Lean
relation remains untagged until its list-backed compiler body is replaced by
the exact HOL `compile` port tracked by bead `flapjack-pxn.18.3.1.4`.
`globals_lookup_probe.out` records direct HOL EVAL of
`pan_to_crepProof$globals_lookup_def` for a present singleton word and a
missing global; the matching Lean guards live in
`Flapjack.Test.PanToCrepGlobalsLookupParity`.
`crep_store_eval_probe.out` records direct HOL `evaluate_def` Store cases from
`cakeml/pancake/semantics/crepSemScript.sml:267`: successful in-domain write,
address-expression failure, value-expression failure, and address-domain
failure. The matching restricted total state evaluator and Lean guards are in
`Flapjack.Pancake.Semantics.CrepSem.TotalEval` and
`Flapjack.Test.CrepSemTotalStoreParity`; the restricted evaluator has no
whole-definition `@[hol]` tag.
`crep_arith_dest_const_probe.out` records direct HOL EVAL of
`crep_arith$dest_const_def` at
`cakeml/pancake/crep_arithScript.sml:10-12` for a constant, variable, load,
and multiplication expression. Its Lean constructor checks live in
`Flapjack.Test.CrepeDestConstParity`.
`crep_arith_lookup_code_probe.out` records the original
`OPTION_MAP (simp_prog ## I)` result for a nonempty code map, directly
exercising the result side of the local `lookup_code` lemma at
`cakeml/pancake/proofs/crep_arithProofScript.sml:162`. Its Lean comparison
uses the exact `lookupCrepHolCode` path in
`Flapjack.Test.CrepeArithLookupCodeParity`.
`crep_dest_2exp_probe.out` records direct HOL EVAL of
`crep_arith$dest_2exp_def` at `cakeml/pancake/crep_arithScript.sml:15`, including
the corresponding `word_lsl 1w` results for successful exponents. Its Lean
destination, shift, and width checks live in `Flapjack.Test.CrepeDest2ExpParity`.
The fixture also evaluates representative instances of the proof helper
`dest_2exp_bound` at `cakeml/pancake/proofs/crep_arithProofScript.sml:10`;
the Lean all-dimension support theorem remains untagged until its explicit
finite-index and `word_log2` encodings are reviewed against HOL.
`hol_fcp_index_n2w_probe.out` records direct HOL EVAL of `n2w` plus concrete
instances of `word_index_n2w` and the underlying `BIT` values for zero, one,
and the highest bit of an 8-bit word; it also records `dimindex (:8) = 8` to
show the sampled indices are valid. The original definition is HOL4
`wordsTheory.n2w_def` (`$HOL/src/n-bit/wordsScript.sml:54-56`);
`word_index_n2w` at lines 1765-1774 states the general numeric-index equation.
The kernel-checked canonical `Fin width`/BitVec equation
`holWordBitsToBitVec_n2w` is in `Flapjack.Pancake.Semantics.CrepSem.Eval`; its
zero/one/high-bit examples are in `Flapjack.Test.CrepeSimpExpParity`.
For any explicit `HolFiniteDimension`, `holFiniteWordN2W_at_index` proves that
the arbitrary-index adapter returns `Nat.testBit value (encode index)`, which
is the pointwise FCP `BIT` equation under the chosen finite-index encoding;
the Bool carrier test exercises this at multiple indices.
`hol_word_arithmetic_probe.out` records the direct HOL4 definitions
`word_add_def`, `word_mul_def`, and `word_sub_def` from the same external
`wordsScript.sml`, along with the general `word_add_n2w` and `word_mul_n2w`
theorems and 8-bit simplification examples. Lean's
`holFiniteWordSourceAdd`/`holFiniteWordSourceMul` encode the source `n2w` of
natural arithmetic on `w2n` values, with generic Fin-index transport theorems
and focused 4-bit checks in `CrepeSimpExpParity`. The pointwise `n2w`/`BIT`
equation is proved for explicit finite dimensions. The recursive
`finWordSBitSum` follows the numeric `Fin` indices and proves the `w2n`
weighted `SBIT` sum equals BitVec `toNat`; the operation adapters are also
rewritten to expose their `n2w`-of-SBitSum source shape. `holFiniteWordSourceSub`
uses the corresponding two's-complement natural formula and its transport
theorem; the test checks wraparound subtraction. The remaining representation
gap is identifying a Lean `HolFiniteDimension` witness with HOL's implicit
`finite_index` choice; the full Crep evaluator correspondence is still open.
`word_op_finite_probe.out` records the original CakeML
`wordLangTheory.word_op_def` list folds (And/Add/Or/Xor/Sub), including empty
fold values and malformed subtraction arities. This worktree's CakeML submodule
has no compiled `wordLangTheory.ui`, so regenerate this probe against a
read-only CakeML checkout with matching source and built theories by setting
`CAKEML` (the checked output was generated from matching CakeML source commit
`857f0d98da8f8a3580f3442338e697809308ede`).
`holFiniteWord_wordOp_toBitVec` proves that the explicit finite-dimension
wordOp list behavior maps through the Fin-index/BitVec conversion for every
operator and argument list; Bool-index checks are in
`Flapjack.Test.CrepeSimpExpParity`. This remains untagged because the theorem
uses explicit dimension data.
`word_sh_finite_probe.out` records the original `wordLang$word_sh_def`, its
`dimindex` guard, and zero, valid, width, and above-width examples. Its source
is `cakeml/compiler/backend/wordLangScript.sml`; the direct Lean transport
`holFiniteWord_evalPanShift_toBitVec` covers all four shift operators for every
explicit finite dimension. A Bool-index instance is checked in
`Flapjack.Test.CrepeSimpExpParity`. This is evaluator infrastructure and does
not by itself establish the unrestricted HOL-polymorphic
`simp_exp_correct1` statement. Regenerate against a read-only CakeML checkout
with matching built theories by setting `CAKEML`; the checked output was
generated from source commit `857f0d98da8f8a3580f3442338e697809308ede`.
`pan_fixed_load_probe.out` prints HOL `mem_load_byte_def` and
`mem_load_32_def` directly, together with the imported `byte_align_def`,
`aligned_def`, `align_def`, `get_byte_def`, `byte_index_def`, and
`word_of_bytes_def`. It evaluates domain misses, alignment failure, both
endiannesses, 8-bit/64-bit word instances, and the 24-bit cases
`byte_align 5w = 4w`, little-endian `mem_load_byte ... {4w} F 5w = SOME 51w`,
and big-endian `mem_load_byte ... {4w} T 5w = SOME 17w`. Those rows
also include the width-24 32-bit load at address 4, whose `word32` result is
`0x22113322`. The added width-4 rows cover both endian branches at addresses 0
and 1 with the nonzero four-bit word `0xB`. Little endian uses
`address MOD 0`, so its index is the address: address 0 extracts `0xB`, while
address 1 shifts past the word and extracts zero. Big endian uses natural
subtraction `0 - 1 - (address MOD 0)`, which saturates to zero at both
addresses, so both extract `0xB`. The accompanying `byte_index`/`get_byte`
rows record the little-endian `1 MOD 0` formula directly. Matching Lean guards
live in `Flapjack.Test.PanSemStateEvalParity`. The width-4 `mem_load_32` rows
exercise the same formulas over addresses 0 through 3: little endian packs the
four bytes `[0xB, 0, 0, 0]` to `0xB`, while big endian packs `[0xB, 0xB, 0xB,
0xB]` to `0x0B0B0B0B`. The direct `word_of_bytes` EVAL rows reduce those packed
results to `11w` and `0xB0B0B0Bw`. They differ
from production RISC-V's `panRiscVByteAlign 3 5 = 3`,
which misses the domain containing only address 4. RISC-V rounds by a multiple
of three while the HOL definition aligns using `LOG2 (dimindex DIV 8)`. The
`holByteAlignedRiscVMemoryModel` overlay uses the source alignment formula and
returns the probed byte while leaving the other RISC-V model operations
explicit. Focused checks for the source overlay and production mismatch are in
`Flapjack.Test.PanFixedLoadParity`. The generic finite-word
`holFiniteWordSourceMemoryModel` adapter uses the same alignment formula and
direct HOL `get_byte` index arithmetic; tests cover both endiannesses at width
24, plus a 24-bit 32-bit-load fixture. Its `aligned` operation is now expressed
as divisibility by the requested byte alignment. The `setByte` operation
implements the pointwise bit-slice cases from HOL `set_byte_def`, and
`wordOfBytes` follows the recursive shape from HOL `word_of_bytes_def`.
`word_byte_memory_probe.out` records those source definitions, the width-17
four-write expansion, and direct HOL EVAL for little- and big-endian width-17
fixtures. A generic theorem relating the explicit dimension enumeration to
HOL's native finite-index word operations remains open. The generic
Crep source helpers `crepHolEvalMemLoadByte` and `crepHolEvalMemLoad32`, plus
their equations to `panModelReadByte`/`panModelRead32`, are in
`Flapjack.Pancake.Semantics.CrepSem`; they keep the `PanMemoryModel` explicit
and remain untagged until its operations are related to HOL's word-derived
`byte_align`, `get_byte`, `aligned`, and `word_of_bytes` for arbitrary finite
dimensions.
The direct `crepSem$eval` fixtures `crep_eval_load_byte_probe.out` and
`crep_eval_load_32_probe.out` also cover width 24: `LoadByte` at address 5
returns `Word 51w` little-endian and `Word 17w` big-endian; `Load32` at address
4 returns `Word 0x113322w`. `Flapjack.Test.PanFixedLoadParity` compares those
original rows against the finite-word source evaluator and records the RISC-V
runtime adapter's `none` result at the same alignment boundary.
The direct width-1 rows `load32_aligned_width1_address0=SOME ...` and
`load32_unaligned_width1_address1=NONE` were refreshed
with `HOL4=/home/zksecurity/HOL CAKEML=/home/zksecurity/flapjack2/cakeml
HOL_PROBE_ONLY=pan_fixed_load_probeScript.sml scripts/hol-probes/regenerate.sh`
against matching CakeML source commit `857f0d98da8f8a3580f3442338e697809308ede`.
The `aligned_width1_address0=T` and `aligned_width1_address1=F` rows confirm
that HOL accepts address zero and rejects address one; `byte_align_width1_address1`
records the source `byte_align` definition at that carrier width. The tagged
Lean `panMemLoad32HOL` states the equivalent modulo-four guard directly; the
matching Lean fixture checks that address zero returns `0x00010001` and address
one returns `none`. HOL EVAL leaves the raw width-one pack in
`get_byte`/shift/concatenation form; a direct HOL simplifier/evaluator pass
proves that expression equals `0x00010001w`. The Lean check computes the same
tagged result.
Direct `word_of_bytes` rows pin the four-byte
little-endian and big-endian packs to `0x44332211` and `0x11223344`; the Lean
fixture checks the same `RiscV.panRiscVWordOfBytes` results. The probe driver
runs this script from `pancake/semantics/.hol/objs` when that directory is
present so it resolves the built `panSemTheory` without modifying the source
submodule.
`word_byte_memory_probeScript.sml` is run from HOL4's built
`src/n-bit/.hol/objs` directory and probes `byteTheory` directly, so it does not
depend on built CakeML Pancake theories. Refresh it with
`HOL_PROBE_ONLY=word_byte_memory_probeScript.sml scripts/hol-probes/regenerate.sh`.
The width-17 word fixtures use four distinct bytes, `0x11`, `0x22`, `0x33`,
and `0x44`, so the HOL recursive overwrite order is visible: little-endian
reduces to `0x2211w` and big-endian to `0x1122w`. The nonzero-initial-value
`set_byte` rows use HOL's proved `set_byte_bit_field_insert` rewrite followed
by evaluation, preserving the other bits while reducing to concrete words.
For initial value `0x1abcdw`, byte `0xa5w` at address `1w` reduces to
`0x1a5cdw` little-endian and `0x1aba5w` big-endian.
The width-5 rows record HOL's `MOD_0` theorem and the resulting zero-byte-slot
`byte_index` branches, which the Lean source adapter handles explicitly.
`crep_arith_eval_mul_const_probe.out` records direct HOL EVAL of
`crepSem$eval` after `crep_arith$mul_const` for zero, one, power-of-two, and
general multipliers, with a word-valued local. Its matching production runtime
cases live in `Flapjack.Test.CrepeMulConstParity`.
`crep_simp_exp_probe.out` records direct HOL EVAL of
`crep_arith$simp_exp_def` (`crep_arithScript.sml:59-64`) for constant folding,
left/right constant multiplication, nested multiplication, and recursive
load/word-operation children. It also evaluates the original
`crepSem$eval` before and after simplifying `Crepop Mul [Var 2; Const 8w]`
with local 2 set to `Word 5w`; the simplifier yields `Shift Lsl (Var 2)
(Const 3w)` and both evaluations return `SOME (Word 40w)`. The matching
production source-runtime observation and all-width theorem application are
in `Flapjack.Test.CrepeSimpExpParity`. These checks exercise the result shape,
but do not close the polymorphic evaluator-preservation theorem
`simp_exp_correct1`; the explicit finite-index adapter's relation to HOL's
implicit word carrier remains open.
`crep_eval_probe.out` records direct HOL EVAL of the `Const`, `Var`, `Load`,
`LoadGlob`, `BaseAddr`, and `TopAddr` constructor cases from
`cakeml/pancake/semantics/crepSemScript.sml:90-166`. The width-8 production
checks live in `Flapjack.Test.CrepEvalConstructorParity`; generic word-result
projection equations live beside `evalCrepRuntimeExp` in
`Flapjack/Pancake/Semantics/CrepSem.lean`. These equations cover a constructor
scope slice only: the target-extended runtime state and the remaining
word-operation and byte-load cases still need an evaluator correspondence.
For the isolated `Const` case of local `simp_exp_correct1`, this direct
`eval_def` observation pairs with the constant-preserving simp results in
`crep_simp_exp_probe.out`; the exact word_lab theorem case and Fin 4 fixture
are `crepSimpExpCorrect1ConstHolFiniteWordSourceCase` and its nearby example
in `Flapjack.Test.CrepeSimpExpParity`. The assembling theorem remains open.
`crep_eval_cmp_rv64_probe.out` records direct HOL `crepSem$eval` results for all
eight `asm$word_cmp_def` constructors, including signed-versus-unsigned order,
negations, and overlapping/disjoint bit tests. Matching source-runtime
comparisons are checked in `Flapjack.Test.CrepeSimpExpParity`; the generic
finite-index-to-BitVec comparison equation is `holFiniteWord_evalPanCmp_toBitVec`.
`pan_globals_compile_top_probe.out` records original Pancake HOL evaluation
of `pan_globals$compile_top` for an absent start function (the total empty-list
result), a present `main` entry, and a global initializer in a nonempty
declaration list. Its Lean checks live in
`Flapjack.Test.PanGlobalsCompileTopForStartParity`.
`pan_structs_afindi_map_probe.out` records direct HOL EVAL for the hit and
miss cases of `afindi_MAP_eq` at
`cakeml/pancake/proofs/pan_structsProofScript.sml:356`; its matching Lean
checks live in `Flapjack.Test.PanStructsAfindiParity`.
`pan_structs_afindi_length_probe.out` records direct HOL EVAL of first and
last successful key indices against `afindi_less_length` at
`cakeml/pancake/proofs/pan_structsProofScript.sml:345`; Lean checks the same
rows in `Flapjack.Test.PanStructsAfindiParity`.
`pan_structs_afindi_el_probe.out` records direct HOL EVAL of the first
component at first, middle and last successful `afindi` indices for
`afindi_EL` at `cakeml/pancake/proofs/pan_structsProofScript.sml:430`; Lean
checks the equivalent `getElem?`-based API in
`Flapjack.Test.PanStructsAfindiParity`.
`pan_structs_alookup_afindi_probe.out` records direct HOL EVAL of present,
missing and duplicate-key cases for `ALOOKUP_eq_afindi` at
`cakeml/pancake/proofs/pan_structsProofScript.sml:405`; matching `List.lookup`
regressions live in `Flapjack.Test.PanStructsAfindiParity`.
`pan_structs_compile_correct_probe.out` records direct HOL EVAL of
`convert_v_def` on a named record, source/converted `Skip` evaluator equations,
and zero-clock timeout / positive-clock decrement `Tick` evaluator equations,
plus HOL simplifier reduction of `convert_s_def` over nonempty local, global,
exception-shape, and function-code finite maps using the finite-map lookup
rules. These are used in `compile_correct` at
`cakeml/pancake/proofs/pan_structsProofScript.sml:1034`. These rows only check
the listed evaluator and conversion equations; they do not prove the full
theorem. The finite-map state interface and actual `compile_correct` Skip,
Tick, Break, and Continue case specializations are tracked separately. The
parent theorem remains open while other statement cases and the complete
induction are unfinished. Lean regressions live in
`Flapjack.Test.PanStructsCompileCorrect`.
`pan_structs_compile_exp_correct_probe.out` records HOL evaluations of Local
and Global variable-constructor instances and Const-, RStruct-, NStruct-,
NField-, RField-, Op-, Load-, and faithful Load32-constructor instances of
`compile_exp_correct`; each
five-element tuple contains old shape, semantic value shape, field validity,
source evaluation, and converted target evaluation. The Var, Const, Shift, and
faithful Load32 cases use `evalPanValueExpFull`; Load32 supplies an explicit
model-backed `read32` access. RStruct, NStruct, NField, RField, Op, Load, and
LoadByte retain their existing evaluator interfaces. These constructor cases
are exercised by finite-map regressions in
`Flapjack.Test.PanStructsCompileCorrect`. They are constructor specializations
of the universal HOL theorem, not a complete induction port, and remain
untagged where the Lean state/evaluator interfaces differ. The RStruct and Op
rows use nonempty expressions: the former checks aggregate construction, while
the latter checks that a binary Op retains exactly its two word operands after
value conversion. Both validate all three constructor conclusions. The
nonempty-list
row separately checks source `OPT_MMAP` success, pointwise compiled-expression
correctness, and the converted `compile_exps` result for the local HOL helper
`compile_exp_correct_mmap_helper`; Lean proves the corresponding production
list-evaluation prerequisite in `panStructCompileExpsEvalOfPointwiseCorrect`.
The Load row directly exercises an explicit two-word memory read and is paired
with a Lean source/converted evaluation fixture. The nested named-load row
checks a multiword `Pair` containing a named `Inner`, including source and
compiled shapes, field validity, and both evaluator results. Its general
constructor case and the required memory-conversion induction remain open. The
`size_of_compile_shape_comb` row separately directly evaluates the HOL
`size_of_compile_shape` prerequisite at
`cakeml/pancake/proofs/pan_structsProofScript.sml:512`; the generic Lean theorem
and concrete fixture live in `Flapjack.Test.PanStructsCompileShapeParity`.
`pan_structs_mem_load_conversion_probe.out` directly evaluates the HOL One
branch, a nested three-word Comb branch, and a nested named `Pair`/`Inner`
branch of `mem_load_conversion` at
`cakeml/pancake/proofs/pan_structsProofScript.sml:609`. The named row prints
the concrete `struct_infos_ok` result separately as `T` (proved from HOL's
`struct_infos_ok_cons`) and prints both the source `NStruct` load and converted
target `RStruct` load values, followed by their expected-value checks. The
corresponding production fuel-loader conversion theorem is kept untagged and
paired with a Lean execution regression in `Flapjack.Test.PanStructsCompileCorrect`.
`pan_structs_shape_context_drop_probe.out` records direct HOL EVAL of
`size_of_sh_with_ctxt_drop` at
`cakeml/pancake/proofs/pan_structsProofScript.sml:99` for `One`, a suffix-found
named structure, and a nested `Comb`. The exact-carrier theorem over
`ShapeHOL`/`StructContextExact` and matching Lean rows live in
`Flapjack.Pancake.Proofs.PanStructs.CompileCorrect` and
`Flapjack.Test.PanStructsShapeContextDropParity`.
`pan_structs_value_validity_probe.out` records direct HOL EVAL of the word,
matching/mismatching named-record, missing-context, and duplicate-key first
match rows for
`v_flds_ok_def` and `is_wf_shape_v_def`; the matching Bool-valued Lean
definitions and regressions live in
`Flapjack.Pancake.Proofs.PanStructs.CompileCorrect` and
`Flapjack.Test.PanStructsValueValidityParity`.
`pan_structs_afindi_append_probe.out` records direct HOL EVAL of prefix-hit,
shifted suffix-hit and missing-key rows for `afindi_append` at
`cakeml/pancake/proofs/pan_structsProofScript.sml:417`; matching Lean cases
live in `Flapjack.Test.PanStructsAfindiParity`.
`pan_structs_dropwhile_afindi_probe.out` records direct HOL EVAL of first-hit,
later-hit and absent-key cases for `dropWhile_afindi` at
`cakeml/pancake/proofs/pan_structsProofScript.sml:334`; matching Lean rows
live in `Flapjack.Test.PanStructsAfindiParity`.
The `longdiv_code_probe.out` fixture probes the original software LongDiv
helper at `cakeml/compiler/backend/data_to_wordScript.sml:829-867` and the
RISC-V target's deliberate LongDiv encoding rejection.
The `prog_if_probe.out` fixture probes the comparison-materialization helper
`prog_if_def` at `cakeml/pancake/crep_to_loopScript.sml:34`, including its
canonical live-set insertion order.
The `compile_crepop_probe.out` fixture probes the RISC-V `Mul` case of
`compile_crepop_def` at line 42 of the same source.
The original Pancake source-level support boundary is also explicit in
`cakeml/pancake/proofs/loop_to_wordProofScript.sml:2285-2291`: `LLongDiv` is
accepted by `loop_inst_ok` only for `x86_64`. Consequently, RISC-V parity must
port the `data_to_word` helper path rather than add a direct RISC-V lowering
for source `LLongDiv`.

`pan_globals_mem_functions_probe.out` records direct HOL EVAL of the
`panLang$functions` projection and the membership instance characterized by the
local theorem `MEM_functions` at
`cakeml/pancake/proofs/pan_globalsProofScript.sml:2380-2387` (the theorem is
`[local]`, so it has no theory-database name). The exact word-indexed port
`Flapjack.Pancake.PanLang.functionsHOL` and its membership theorem
`MEM_functionsHOL` are paired with the Lean regression
`Flapjack.Test.PanGlobalsMemFunctionsHOLParity`.

From the repository root, with HOL4 and the CakeML checkout available,
regenerate both checked-in outputs with:

```sh
scripts/hol-probes/regenerate.sh
```

Normal Lean CI consumes the checked-in output and does not require HOL4. A
reviewer with HOL4 can rerun the command and inspect the diff. Each probe's
declaration and source path make its reference boundary explicit. The script
is incremental: a fixture is rerun only when its probe, the Pancake theory it
observes, or the script itself is newer than that fixture. Delete a fixture
when a forced regeneration is desired. To refresh one fixture while developing,
set `HOL_PROBE_ONLY` to its probe filename, for example:

```sh
HOL_PROBE_ONLY=pan_globals_compile_top_probeScript.sml scripts/hol-probes/regenerate.sh
```

The checked-in source-facing compiler corpus at
`scripts/parity-small-corpus.json` complements these semantic probes. Run
`scripts/parity-small-corpus.py` after building `flapjack-compile` to invoke
the original `cake --pancake --target=riscv` compiler and Flapjack on the same
five supported programs. The manifest records each original Cake stdout hash,
the CakeML semantic definition exercised by the fixture, and the P1 beads that
own any current generated/user-code differences. The runner compares the
complete runtime, generated-entry, and user-function sections; it does not
normalize instruction bytes.

The focused Pan-to-Crep fixtures are summarized in
[`docs/PAN-TO-CREP-PARITY-COVERAGE.md`](../../docs/PAN-TO-CREP-PARITY-COVERAGE.md).
CI validates that each listed direct-HOL case remains present in its committed
probe output and in the corresponding Lean test with
`scripts/pan-to-crep-coverage-report.py --check`.

`loop_sem_lprefix_lub_probe.out` records the empty-family result and HOL EVAL
of `build_lprefix_lub` for the conflicting non-chain family
`{fromList [1], fromList [2]}`. HOL leaves the selected event as Hilbert
choice (`@x`) in that case; `build_lprefix_lub_thm` only characterizes the LUB
when the input is an `lprefix_chain`. The matching source review is beside
`SemanticsRunResHOL` in `Flapjack/Pancake/Semantics/PanProps.lean`. Refresh it
with `HOL_PROBE_ONLY=loop_sem_lprefix_lub_probeScript.sml
scripts/hol-probes/regenerate.sh`.

`crep_inline_alist_map_probe.out` records direct HOL EVAL of the inline-map
input carrier at `crep_inlineScript.sml:259-269`: `alist_to_fmap` keeps the
first duplicate association-list binding, lookups for another row are
preserved, DOMSUB removes the selected key, and the input row order remains
visible. The exact Lean input carrier and regressions are in
`Flapjack.Pancake.CrepInline.Pass` and
`Flapjack.Test.CrepInlineFmapParity`. Refresh it with
`HOL_PROBE_ONLY=crep_inline_alist_map_probeScript.sml scripts/hol-probes/regenerate.sh`.
